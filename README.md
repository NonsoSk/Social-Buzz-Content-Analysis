# Overview
This project is a comprehensive Power BI task completed as part of my Accenture Virtual Internship program. The goal is to solve business challenges faced by Social Buzz, a rapidly growing client, by utilizing data analytics to generate actionable insights.

# Introduction
In this internship, I assumed the simulated role of a data analyst at Accenture, tasked with addressing business challenges using data-driven solutions. Social Buzz, the client, required support in auditing its big data practices, offering recommendations for an IPO, and analyzing popular content to drive decision-making.

Here are the key Deliverables:

- Audit and analysis of big data practices.
- Recommendations for IPO readiness.
- Identification of top content categories using data visualizations


# Problem Statement
Social Buzz, experiencing rapid growth in recent years, lacked the internal capacity to manage its expansive data operations. As such, the aim of this project is to:

- Identify the top five most popular content categories based on reaction scores.
- Generate insights into content performance to support business strategies.
- Recommend optimizations for Social Buzz’s content strategy to foster sustained growth.


### Skills Demonstrated in the Project

**Data Cleaning**: Addressing redundancies, handling missing values, and standardizing data types.

**Data Visualization**: Creating insight-rich visuals using Power BI and storytelling techniques.

**Business Communication**: Delivering findings and recommendations tailored to the client’s needs.

# Data Transformation and Cleaning

Data Cleaning Steps:

- Removed irrelevant columns.
- Handled missing values by removing incomplete rows.
- Standardized data types for consistency.

Data Merging:

I integrated three datasets into a unified cleaned dataset for analysis.

The final Cleaned Dataset can be found [HERE](https://github.com/NonsoSk/Social-Buzz-Content-Analysis/blob/main/Cleaned%20Dataset.xlsx)

# Analysis Proper
**Lets begin with the KPIs.**

For the KPIs, we can notice a strong correspondence between the total number of reactions and posts. This suggests that audience engagement is proportional to the volume of content published.

Another important point to note is the average reaction score, which is **“39.62”**. This also suggests consistently good content quality, but further stratification is needed to determine whether this applies across all categories or primarily the top ones.

In the Top 5 content categories,

As seen above, "Animals" category leads with the highest reactions (1,897), suggesting it resonates most with the audience. The other categories, while competitive, show slightly lower engagement levels.

However, also notice the narrow gap between categories. This indicates potential for these categories to interchange positions if strategy is adjusted to emphasize their strengths.

In our second visual which shows the number of posts per month as can be seen below,

Here are the few insights that can be gotten

January shows a significant peak in posts (2,142), but a sharp drop occurs in February. This fluctuations could be from seasonal factors, internal resource constraints, or even shifts in audience behavior.

Secondly, a resurgence from March through June followed by fluctuations suggests an opportunity to stabilize posting frequency.

# Conclusion

In the analysis, we successfully identified the top five content categories driving engagement on Social Buzz and posts made on monthly basis. The results also shed light on reaction type distributions, emphasizing likes and shares as critical engagement indicators. These insights are pivotal in optimizing Social Buzz’s strategy for user engagement and future scalability.

# Recommendations

Based on the analysis, Social Buzz has a strong foundation for content performance but must adopt a more strategic, data-driven approach to ensure sustained growth and scalability. Below are my detailed recommendations to facilitate growth.

1) Focus resources on creating more content in high-performing categories like "Animals," "Science," and "Healthy Eating," because maximizing output in proven categories will amplify engagement, drive user retention, and attract new audiences.

2) Even though the top five categories are performing well, I also recommend exploring opportunities within less explored categories. Identify niche interests that align with current trends because diversification of contents offered will help Social Buzz expand its audience base and reduce over-reliance on existing popular categories.
3) Focus on publishing high-quality content during January and December, as these months show high audience activity.

4) Address the monthly fluctuations in content posting by developing a consistent posting schedule, especially targeting months with dips like February, to maintain audience engagement year-round because regular postings minimizes audience drop-off and keep the brand top-of-mind across different periods.

5) Break down engagement by reaction types (e.g., likes, comments, shares) to better understand how users interact with content. The reason is simple, understanding reaction dynamics will enable the creation of more targeted strategies, such as content that drives more shares (expanding reach) or comments (building community).

6) Regularly revisit dashboards and incorporate user feedback to improve the data insights and visualizations. A dynamic feedback loop ensures Social Buzz remains agile, responding to market changes quickly and refining strategies based on real-time insights.
